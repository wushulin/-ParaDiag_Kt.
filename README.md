These illustrating codes are used for testing the ParaDiag algorithm for linear initial value ODE system M*u'+K(t)*u=g and Nonlinear ODE system u'+f(u)=0
The complete steps for constructing the preconditioner is described in the paper 'PARADIAG FOR EVOLUTIONARY PROBLEMS WITH VARIABLE
COEFFICIENT' finished by Xuelei Lin and me. 

There are three zip files and in each file you can find ParaDiag_solver.m which is the main file to compare the three preconditioners mentioned
in the above paper. I put explanations in English for this main code.  

There are several supporting functions collected in the folder 'Common_Functions' in each zip file.  
I also added necessary explanations for each function and if you have problem to use the codes please connect me via wushulin84@hotmail.com or wusl393@nenu.edu.cn
